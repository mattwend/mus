!!BE CAREFUL AND AT LEAST LOWER YOUR VOLUME!!

This is a very early version of a modular synthesizer framework.
main.cc is the reference software synthesizer using this framework.
The goal is to make it very easy to build synthesizers.
The focus right now is on the abstract model.
For now, the goal is not to implement any special signal processing models (e.g. circuit simulation).

How to compile
